# (Individual) Tutorials Assignment

## Overview
The general purpose of the tutorials I chose was to learn more about the stack our group picked.
[Mern!](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack), aka mongodb, express, reactjs, and nodejs is the stack we chose to go
with and I wanted to fully dive into all of the ins and outs of using this stack.
